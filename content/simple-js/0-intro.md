Hello!

I'm writing _Simple Javascript_ because I feel there's a need for a well-organized tutorial series on JavaScript that goes into depth on the details while staying focused on only the useful, pleasing parts of the language. In this series I plan on providing my insights as an intermediate-level professional software developer and reflect on what I would've liked to read a few years back as a novice.

We must address the connotation inherent in the title. You might be wondering, _"Simple" - won't this tutorial be too easy to provide an effective foundation?_ Great question! My view on this is that a lot of technically complex ideas can be relayed in a simplistic manner without relaxing the standards of providing high quality, useful, applicable information. I hope you come to think so too!

I will strip away the parts of the language that have become unnecessary or outmoded, in order to spend more time focusing on the paradigms that are typical of quality software development in JavaScript. If you feel I've left out anything important, feel free to read this series first and then springboard to other topics!

Below is an outline of the topics that'll be covered in this series, and I'll link to each of the new posts as they become live.

Thanks for reading!
