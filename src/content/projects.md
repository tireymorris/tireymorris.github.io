Feed-forward neural network with gradient descent and backpropagation, capable of solving simple problems like XOR and with optimization, potential to solve problems such as image classification

## [Tiny Matrix](https://github.com/tireymorris/tinymatrix)

Simple matrix math library used in Tiny Neuron to handle the underlying math of backpropagation and weight/bias tuning

## [Tiny Genesis](https://github.com/tireymorris/tinygenesis)

Neuroevolution library built on the principles of the [NEAT algorithm](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf), developed at UT Austin by Ken Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen
