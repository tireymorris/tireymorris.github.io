I'm **Ty Morris**, a Software Engineer in Austin, TX. Here's my [resume](/resume.pdf)!

I specialize in full-stack development, primarily with React.js and Node.js, and I have experience in backends written in Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, and C#/.NET.

I attended the University of Texas at Austin from 2014 to 2017 and received a B.S. in Computer Science.

Do you have any questions or want to contact me? Feel free to shoot me an email at [info@tirey.me](mailto:info@tirey.me)
